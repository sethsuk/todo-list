# Simple Todo List Web App

This project was created using Node.js for the backend and React with Material UI for the frontend. Moreover, it relies on RESTful APIs and a PostgreSQL database to implement a continuous state independent of user sessions. The project's frontend is hosted on GitHub pages, while the backend and database are hosted on [Render](https://render.com/).

## Live Website
